# Workout Buddy MERN Project ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Workout Buddy is a MERN Stack project that covers all fundamental features and functionalities for frontend and backend.

It's a valuable project in terms of making practice with MongoDB, Expressjs, Reactjs, and Nodejs.

I completed this project following the MERN Stack series of [Shaun](https://github.com/iamshaunjp).
